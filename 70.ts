// Question 70: Understanding let in Loops: Write a function that uses a loop with the let keyword to print
// numbers from 1 to 5. Explain how the let keyword affects the visibility of the loop variable.
// Explain & TIP: The let keyword provides block scope in JavaScript, which means variables declared with let
//  inside a loop are only accessible within that loop. This helps avoid unintended interference with other parts
//  of your code.

// solution:
//  This function prints numbers from 1 to 5 using a loop
function printNumbersWithLet(){
    for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++ ){
        console.log(i);
    }
}
printNumbersWithLet();
